Objective:
Compare the performance of String (O(N²)), StringBuilder (O(N)), and StringBuffer (O(N)) when concatenating a million strings.
Approach:
Using String (Immutable, creates new object each time)
Using StringBuilder (Fast, mutable, thread-unsafe)
Using StringBuffer (Thread-safe, slightly slower than StringBuilder)
Comparative Analysis:
Operations Count (N)
String (O(N²))
StringBuilder (O(N))
StringBuffer (O(N))

Expected Result:
StringBuilder & StringBuffer are much more efficient than String.
Use StringBuilder for single-threaded operations and StringBuffer for multi-threaded.
